			Fragile quantum features such as entanglement have been employed to 
			improve the precision of parameter estimation, thus inevitably the 
			quantum gain is vulnerable to noises. As an established tool to 
			subdue noises, quantum error correction is unfortunately 
			overprotective because the quantum enhancement can still be achieved 
			even if the states are unrecoverably affected, provided that the 
			quantum Fisher information, which sets the ultimate limit to the 
			precision of metrological schemes, is preserved and attained. Here, 
			we shall present a robust metrological scheme that can preserve the 
			quantum Fisher information instead of the quantum states themselves 
			against noises. After deriving a minimal set of testable conditions 
			on this kind of robustness, we construct a family of 2t + 1 qubits 
			metrological schemes that are immune to t-qubit errors. In 
			comparison at least five qubits are required for correcting 
			arbitrary 1-qubit errors in standard quantum error correction.</font></p>

			Graphene has properties attractive for spintronics applications and 
			various graphene based spintronic devices have been proposed. 
			However, many issues still remaining and one of them is the low 
			efficiency of spin-injection from a metal lead to graphene. Using 
			first-principles calculations, we investigated the efficiency of 
			spin injection from a ferromagnetic electrode (Ni) into graphene and 
			a possible enhancement by using a barrier between the electrode and 
			graphene. Three types of barriers, h-BN, Cu(111), and graphite, of 
			various thickness (0-3 layers) were considered, and the electrically 
			biased conductance of the Ni/barrier /graphene junction was 
			calculated. It was found that the minority-spin-transport channel of 
			graphene can be strongly suppressed by the insulating h-BN barrier, 
			resulting in a high spin-injection efficiency. On the other hand, 
			the calculated spin-injection efficiency of Ni/Cu/graphene or 
			Ni/graphite/graphene junctions is low, due to the spin-conductance 
			mismatch. Further examination of the electronic structure of the 
			system revealed that the high spin-injection efficiency in the

			Nanoscale materials have attracted great interests in recent years.

			nanowalls, nanosheets, and nanojunctions or networks are an 
			important category of nanostructured materials with great potential 
			as important components for nanoscale devices with various

			have been developed for the synthesis of such nanostructured

			studies of hybrid nanomaterials. With these efforts, a wide variety 
			of nanostructured materials have been investigated. These include

			Efficient and extensive harvesting of solar energy is essential to 
			solving energy and environmental crises. Photovoltaics and 
			photocatalysis are two potentially most important means of 
			harvesting solar energy. Sunlight can be absorbed by semiconductors 
			to generate hot electrons and holes, subsequently generating 
			photocurrent in photovoltaics, or, in photocatalysis, driving 
			desirable uphill chemical reactions such as producing hydrogen from 
			water splitting, CO2 conversion to useful hydrocarbons, and 
			degrading organic pollutants. The interaction of semiconductor with 
			sunlight is rather weak, which severely limits solar energy 
			harvesting efficiency. Au and Ag nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit strong 
			localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect, in which the 
			photonic field around NP surface is enhanced dramatically comparing 
			with the far field. Such photonic field concentration leads to light 
			trapping cross-sections much greater than semiconductor NPs, 
			nanowires and organic dyes. LSPR can also result in hot carrier 
			generation and local heating. When integrating plasmonic NPs with 
			semiconductors, LSPR can significantly improve the efficiency of 
			solar energy trapping and conversion. In thin-film solar cells, the 
			strong localization and scattering of incident light by integrating 
			plasmonic NPs can significantly increase light absorption by the 
			semiconductor, thus raise cell efficiency. In photocatalysis, the 
			LSPR of metal NPs can generate hot carriers and inject them into the 
			semiconductor, or enhance the local light field in the adjacent 
			semiconductor which also can yield more electrons and/or holes. Both 
			processes can dramatically promote desirable chemical reactions. I

			dichalcogenide (2D TMD) materials which can in principle compensate 
			some of the disadvantages of graphene, such as lack of a energy
